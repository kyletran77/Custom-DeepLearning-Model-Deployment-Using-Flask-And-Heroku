Task: Reserve a hotel room for 2 people in Times Square in New York City,
New York for 12/31/2022 through 1/1/2023. The hotel room must be
accessible and accommodate for a wheelchair.

Target user: Our target users will be adults ages 18+ that have an active
credit card and have access to and are comfortable navigating the internet
and websites. They do not need to know how to book a hotel or have travel
experience.

Assumptions:

1) The user is using a PC and is connected to Wifi.
2) The user knows how to get to Expedia.com.
3) The user is using Google Chrome.
4) The user has the webpage maximized (not fullscreen or minimized in
any way), as the interface changes based on the size of the window.

Cognitive Walkthrough

1. Click on the “Going to” button

a. The goal of the user is to choose the destination of their stay in order to

find a hotel room near that destination.

b. Yes, the “Going to” button on large and is in the center of the screen.
c. Yes, the search bar has a label and a pinpoint icon to signify that the user

needs to input their destination there.

d. Yes, once the “Going to” button is clicked, a pop-up will appear with a text
input that asks where the user is going, which is cognitively the next step
and is good feedback for the user.

2. Type in “Times Square”

a. The goal of the user here is to enter their desired destination in order to

tell Expedia where the possible hotels should be located.

b. The search bar is large and relatively centered. There is also a cursor

indicating the user to type.

c. Yes, the search bar is labeled with the phrase “Where do you want to go”.

d.

This could be even better labeled if it said “Type where you want to go”.
If the user types in “Times Square”, the search text area will populate with
relevant destinations, the user will see their destination at the top of the
text area indicating that the search bar understood what their destination
is.

3. Click the “Times Square” option from the list

a. The goal of the user here is to select their destination from the options

b.

Expedia provides.
“Times Square” will be at the top of the text area, the text is large, and
when hovered over, the cursor will update which indicates that the user
can click.

c. No, there are no labels for each selection that indicates that clicking one of

them will result in this step being completed. Only, when the user hovers
over one of the options will a label that says “Going to” appear.

d. The “Going To” button will update with the user's selected destination

which is good feedback that they have completed this step.

4. Click on the “Check-in” or “Check-out” button

a. The user's goal here is to enter the dates they want to book a hotel room

in order to tell Expedia how long the hotel reservation should be. The
subgoal here is to enter the check-in date.

b. Yes, the “Check-in” and “Check-out” button is large and is centered on the

screen.

c. No, the button is automatically filled in with dates, and there is no signifier

that tells the user that clicking the button changes the dates.

d. When the user clicks on the “Check-in” button, a calendar interface pops
up indicating that the user selects their dates. This is good feedback that
the user is going in the right direction.

5. Click the arrow near the top-right of the calendar interface until you can see the

month of December

a. The user’s goal here is to change the calendar interface so that the user

can select their desired check-in date to December 31st.

b. Yes, the arrow icon is large and is located in an obvious place. However, it

could be even more obvious with a label.

c. The icon is of an arrow pointing to the right which matches the user's goal

of changing the interface. However, the interface assumes the user
understands that moving the calendar to the right is going forward in time.
d. When the user clicks the arrow, the calendar interface updates by showing
the next month. This is good feedback because the interface updates with
each click and shows the months moving in the right direction.

6. Click on the 31st of December date for the check-in date

a. The user’s goal is to select their desired start date on the calendar

interface.

b. No, while the interface shows the days of the month of December, it does

not obviously show that the user can select any of the days.

c. No, once the user figures out that hovering over a day in the month is like
hovering over a button (the cursor changes), there’s no guarantee that the
user understands clicking on a day selects it as there is no label.

d. Once the user clicks on a day of the month, the day is highlighted with a

blue circle which is good feedback that the day is selected.

7. Click the arrow on the right of the pop-up calendar until you see the month of

January

a. The user understands that they have selected their check-in date at this

point, so their current goal is to change the calendar interface so they can
select their check-out date which is January 1st, 2023.

b. Yes, the arrow icon is large and is located in an obvious place. However, it

could be even more obvious with a label.

c. The icon is of an arrow pointing to the right which matches the user's goal

of changing the interface. However, the interface assumes the user
understands that moving the calendar to the right is going forward in time.
d. When the user clicks the arrow, the calendar interface updates by showing
the next month. This is good feedback because the interface updates with
each click and shows the months moving in the right direction.

8. Click on the 1st January date for the check-out date

a. The user’s goal is to select their desired end date on the calendar

interface.

b. No, while the interface shows the days of the month of December, it does

not obviously show that the user can select any of the days.

c. No, once the user figures out that hovering over a day in the month is like
hovering over a button (the cursor changes), there’s no guarantee that the
user understands clicking on a day selects it as there is no label.

d. Once the user clicks on a day of the month, the day is highlighted with a

blue circle which is good feedback that the day is selected.

9. Click the blue “Done” button

a. At this point, the user understands that they have entered in their desired
check-in and check-out dates and they want to finalize their selection and
continue with the search.

b. Yes, the done button is large and has high contrast colors.
c. Yes, the label fits the user's desired actions perfectly as the user wants to

be “done” with the date selection and move on to the next step.

d. When the user clicks the done button, the calendar interface disappears

and the check-in and check-out buttons are updated to show the dates the
user selected which is good feedback that they are done with that goal.

10.Click the blue “Search” button

a. The user is trying to submit the information to get the results expected by

the travel details.

b. Yes, the necessary actions in the interface show that the search button is

clear and separated from the rest of the UI components in bold blue.

c. The button is recognizable with the words “Search” for the users.
d. The feedback is good because the web page refreshes to show the results

expected for the information.

11. Scroll down until you see the “Sort and Filter” section of the page and click

“WheelChair-Accessible parking, Accessible bathroom, Roll-in Shower, In-room
accessibility, and stair-free path to entrance”

a. The user is trying to filter the results for the Wheelchair accessible rooms.

21.Click on the text box under “Security code” and type in your card’s security code

a. The goal of the user here to type their card’s security code and continue to

enter in their credit card information to successfully reserve the hotel

b. Yes, the security code entry element is legible, and when the user selects
the entry box, a small graphic of a credit card is displayed showing where
to find the card’s security code.

c. Yes, the entry box element is labeled correctly. When the user hovers over
the entry box element another label is displayed that tells the user what to
do, which exactly matches their goal here.

d. When the user enters in a valid security code, the graphic of the credit

card disappears indicating that they are not on that step anymore. This is
not the greatest feedback, but due to this page being a form that needs to
be fully filled out before a button can be clicked, it’s good enough
feedback.

22.Click on the text box under “Billing ZIP code” and type in your zip code

a. The goal of the user here is to type their card’s billing zip code and finish

confirmation email of the reservation, but that is not a direct goal here.

b. Yes, Email address entry element is legible and it is apparent that the user

has to enter information there.

c. Yes, the entry box element is labeled correctly. When the user hovers over
the entry box element another label is displayed that tells the user what to

uses contrasting colors.

arrow as a signifier that the user is finishing this step and moving to the
next one (which in this case is the final step).

d. When the user clicks the button, the page refreshes and shows a

address they previously entered. Both of these are good forms of
feedback that the user has completed their end goal.

Summary

Expedia.com advertises its website to users who are interested in a quick and easy
hotel booking and reservation process. Their website is styled neatly and interface
elements are mostly large and centered. This leaves the question: can a user with little
to no experience in vacation planning, reserve a hotel room in their desired locations
and with their desired specifications, in a quick and timely manner?

Our findings suggest that Expedia.com does a great job of allowing a user to
accomplish this goal. Expedia streamlines the process of reserving into the following
steps:

1. Enter your destination location and check-in/check-out time.
2. Find the hotel with the user’s desired specifications.
3. Enter in credit card and personal information.

and by assuring that each of these steps are largely different from each other, with
different interfaces, new webpages after the completion of each of the steps above, and
methodical labels that fit the user’s mental model, Expedia.com provides strong
feedback to its user that they are heading towards their goal. However, where
Expedia.com leaps over the gulf of evaluation, it sinks into the gulf of execution. In most
of the steps in the process, Expedia.com puts a lot of trust in the user that they’ll be able
to perceive and interpret the various interfaces to find their desired actions. For
example, when the user is entering their check-in/check-out dates, the user needs to
interact with the calendar interface. While the interface uses a very familiar formatting,
Expedia.com assumes that the user has used a similar interface and thus the calendar
element does not have any labels indicating what the user should be doing. In
particular, there are no directions or labels stating that clicking a day in the calendar
interface is the only way to select the date. On top of this, Expedia.com doesn’t allow
manual text input of the user's desired check-in/check-out dates and forces the user to
interact with an interface that could be unfamiliar to the user. One way to remedy this
glaring issue is to fill the whitespace around and within the calendar element with text
labels or a short list of directions stating exactly how to use the interface. More simply,
Expedia.com could just allow for manual entry of the user’s desired dates.

Another example of Expedia.com failing to provide an obvious display of available
actions that relates specifically to the target user of this walkthrough, is when the user
wants to input their desired specifications in order to accommodate for their disabilities.
When Expedia.com brings users to the page listing the possible hotels, there is no
obvious element that allows the user to filter the available hotels according to their
specifications. In fact, the user has to scroll down a significant amount in order to find

the small element with accommodations checkboxes. Of course, if the user doesn’t
understand that scrolling down will reveal more of the page, the user will be stuck on
this step and perhaps never proceed. One interesting thing to note is that this issue is
only apparent when the user is in full-screen mode; when the webpage is minimized,
there is a large “Sort and Filter” button that is at the top of the page. We suggest that
having this button at the top of the page regardless of the size of the page would
improve the user’s experience for the step in the process.

Despite this issue, Expedia.com manages to provide a quality and streamlined user
experience through the use of clean interfaces, large and centered elements, and
strong feedback. However, accommodating the more specific use cases of the website,
such as booking a hotel room with specific disability accommodations, by increasing the
use of text labels and the visibility of more niche elements of the page, would drastically
improve the usability of the website.

Our definition of information visualization

The activity of transforming abstract data into visual 

representations to improve human cognition.

In this course : 

- Abstract data will be numerical and non-numerical
- Visual representations will be mostly static

Department of Informatics, UC Irvine

Why visualization

• Tell a story about the data

• Discover a story from the data

– “The purpose of computing is insight, not numbers” Richard Hamming

Department of Informatics, UC Irvine

3

Why visualization

• Amplifies cognition

– Expand working memory

– Reduce searching time

– Pattern detection

– Inference

Readings in Information Visualization: Using Vision to Think, Card, Mackinley, Shneiderman eds., MK, 1998

Department of Informatics, UC Irvine

Challenges

• What are the principles for designing effective visualizations?

• What are the tools to produce visualization?

• How to deal with large data?

• But to begin with: 

Is there a common language?

Scales

•

Important: Keep scales to the minimum required
– It is easier for human cognition: it simplifies understanding!

• Typically: 

– Two positions
– One color

– Two positions
– One color
– One size

Coordinate systems and axes

• First step in the construction of a visual representation

• Where the different data values are located?

• How they are related to each other?

– Horizontaly? Verticaly? At an angle? Along a circle? On the surface of 

a sphere? Like a spiral? 

– Linearly? Logarithmically? Discretized? 

The choice of the position scales and how they are arranged geometrically is what 

sets a cooridnate system in the context of visualization.

Coordinate systems : Cartesian

• Most used system in visualization

– Intuitive for most people
– In 2D, a pair (p1, p2) of Reals maps to a position (x, y) in a space 

where x and y axis are orthogonal

Nonlinear scales in the axes

• Linear scales are usually easier for the brain to interpret

– But probably because people are used to them
– So stick to it if you can

• But in many cases nonlinear scales are prefeered:
– I.e. lots of small and very big numbers in the same dataset

• Some other scales:

– Logarithmic scale (“log scale”)
– Square-root scale (“sqrt scale”)
– More atypical: Hyperbolic arcsin scale

• Like log scale for big numbers, and linear for small numbers

Visualization of Distributions

• Usefull to visualize how a set of numbers is distributed

– E.g. how many students of a certain age are enrolled in ICS

– Very informal definition of distribution: The relative proportions of the 

diferent numbers is called “the distribution” of these numbers.

Department of Informatics, UC Irvine

2

Visualization of Distributions

• Usefull to visualize how a set of numbers is distributed

– E.g. how many students of a certain age are enrolled in ICS

• Data has:

– At least one set of values (qualitative or quantitative)

• Some standard geometrical mappings: 

– Histograms plot
– Density plots
– Cumulative densities
– Boxplots, violins

Department of Informatics, UC Irvine

3

Visualization of Distributions

• One problem with histograms and density plots:

– Both depend on user selected parameters
– They result from an interpretation of the data

• Alternative (bad):

– Just visualize every data point as a large point cloud
– Not feasible for large datasets
– Too much emphasis on individual data points

• Better alternatives:

– Empirical cumulative distribution functions (ECDFs)
– Quantile-quantile plots

• No arbitrary parameter choices
• All the data is displayed
• Drawback : less intuitive, thus more difficult to interpret

Visualization of Distributions: ECDFs

• Example: dataset of student grades

# setting a seed for a random number generator
set.seed(31415)

# creating the random grades
points = round(c(rnorm(47, mean = 87, sd = 10), 45, 51, 67))

# grades cannot be greater than 100...
points[points > 100] <- 100

# organize into a dataframe and rank
student_data <- data.frame(points, 

rank = rank(points, ties.method = ""random""))

• Most commonly adopted choices for the visualization:

– Individual points are not shown
– Y-axis represent the cumulative frequency

• How to create in ggplot2?

– Just remove the call to geom_point() and do not multiply y by the total

15

Visualization of Distributions: ECDFs

• After you learn it exists, it is simple to interpret!

Approximately 20% of the students 

have 90 or more points

The median grade of 

the class is 81

A quarter of the students received 

less than 75 points

Department of Informatics, UC Irvine

16

Visualization of Distributions: ECDFs

• The case of skewed distributions

– Existence of heavy tails make visualization challenging

– E.g. number of people living in diferente cities, contacts in social 

networks, word frequencies (Zipf’s law!), richness in the world, etc.

– Decay is slower than exponential

• Mean of the distribution is small, but there are many large values

– Example of skewed distribution: power-law

Visualization of Distributions: Q-Q plots

• Quantile-quantile plots

– Used to determine if data follow or not a certain distribution

– Just as ECDFs they are based on ranking data points and 

visualizing the relation between data and rank

– Ranks are used to predict where a point should fall if the data 

follows the reference distribution

– The Normal distribution is widely used as reference

Visualization of Distributions: Simplest approach

• Divide the data into subsets using the grouping variable
•
• Display points at the mean/median/mode and add the dispersion metric as a bar

Compute mean/medians/mode and some dispersion metric for each subset

Visualization of proportions

• Useful to visualize how some groups or amount split into individual 

pieces that sum to a whole
– E.g. proportions of gender in a group, votes in elections, market shares, 

supercomputing technologies, etc.

• Data has:

– At least one set of values (qualitative or quantitative) that add to a whole

• Some standard geometrical mappings: 

– Pie charts
– Bars, stacked bars and stacked densities
– Mosaic plots
– Treemaps
– Parallel sets

• How to read it?

– Suppose that you have a data set of a parliament composed by three 

parties. Each political party has a certain number of seats. 

– A pie chart visual representation is created when you use a circle and 
divide it in slices respecting the proportions set by the proportions of 
the seats in the entire parliament.

• How to build a pie chart in ggplot2?

– There is not a geom for it! 
– In baseline R you can use pie(). In ggplot we can use a trick: make a 

bar chart and transform it to polar coordinates.

bundesdata <- data.frame(

Party=c(""CDU/CSU"", ""SPD"", ""FDP""),

Visualization of proportions

• Problems:

– Hard for the mind to fully understand angles...
– If talking about proportions, it should never go beyond 100%... 
– Do not use 3D: there is no additional information there...

Visualization of multiple proportions

• Useful to investigate how the proportions evolve over multiple 

categorical variables at once
– E.g. how the proportions of seats are distributed by party and gender, 

what is the health status of individuals by gender and maritial status, etc.

• Data has:

– More than two set of values (qualitative or quantitative) that add to a 

whole and that can be split into multiple categories

• Some standard geometrical mappings: 

– Mosaic plots
– Treemaps
– Nested pies (be careful!)
– Parallel sets

Visualization of multiple proportions

• Mosaic plots

– It is not a stacked bar plot!
– There is variation of the sizes in the x and y axis.
– Every categorical variable shown must cover all observations.

Department of Informatics, UC Irvine

40

Visualization of multiple proportions

• Mosaic plots

– How to create the mosaic?

– Start by dividing the x axis into the categories following the relative 

proportions;

– Within each x-category, subvidide the y-axis into the relative 

proportions of the objects in that category.

– Resulting rectangle have areas that are proportional to the number of 

datapoints in each pair of categorical variables

Department of Informatics, UC Irvine

41

Visualization of multiple proportions

• Treemaps plots

– Similar to mosaic plots, but distinct way to split rectangles
– Recursively nest rectangles inside each other

• Treemaps plots

– How to create the nesting?

– First subdivide the total area of the rectangle into proportions of one 

categorical variable

– Then subdivide each rectangle following the proportions of the 

second categorical variable

• Mosaic and treemaps

– Mosaic plots assume that all proportions can be identified via 

combinations of categorical variables. 

– Tree maps allow more free combinations.

• Mosaic and treemaps

– Different emphasis.

– Mosaic plots assume that all proportions can be identified via 

combinations of categorical variables. Tree maps allow more free 
combinations.

– Both are used.

– Both have similar limitations as stacked bars: difficult direct 

comparison due to lack of shared baselines.
• If you are using these techniques, showing the actual counts can help.

• Parallel sets

– A mapping that works for more than two categorical variables

– Display independent vertical bars with the relative proportions for 

each categorical variable

– Join them via semi-transparent bands to indicate how the groups 

relate to each other.

Important to consider when using Parallel sets

– Usually chose the coloring scheme starting from the leftmost variable

– Organize the variables to minimize the crossing of the shaded bands
